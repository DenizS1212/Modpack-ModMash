# A page for the modpack "modmash" on modrinth.
## I created this modpack for the purpose of basically every mod i like combined to be shared.
There's 1 version where it's just the bare bones of the modpack and one where it's my version.

I only created this page for bugs and stuff and i'm not into coding or github in general. Just wanted to use the standart for bug reports.
